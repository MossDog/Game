# Big Awesome Idle Tower Defense Game
--------------------------------------
## Ideas


## To Do List
- Consider different Art styles
- Figure out different fields like health and damage, how do these scale depending on the round?
- Add storing and loading player stats from CSV

### Completed
- Figure out where collision detection belongs and implement it properly
- implemented cooldown times so gamespeed isn't dependant on frames
- Implemented the beam as the primary weapon
- implemented rudimentary health system and speed system
- rounds are now cycled when arrayList is not populated
- enemies can now die
- player can now die

## Note
- There are redundant libraries in /lib/
- Move still needs to be adapted to work based off of time
